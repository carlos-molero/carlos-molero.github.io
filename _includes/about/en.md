Hello there! (Any Star Wars fans out there? ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ) my name is Carlos Molero and I've been a professional software developer for 4 years.

My vocation has always been psychology but during my studies at the University of MÃ¡laga I had the opportunity to take my first steps in programming with R for statistical analysis. Given the lack of solutions provided by psychology based on observation and qualitative methods, I wanted to delve deeper into the analysis of quantitative data to study, predict and improve human behavior (I am a hardcore behaviorist). It was then that I fell in love with programming.

I currently work at [@Sprinter](https://www.sprintersports.com/) as a backend engineer (Java/Spring Boot) & Cloud Architect. I am also open to freelance contracts as long as they are interesting for me.

The purpose of this website is to share posts about the knowledge I've been gathering throughout my years of professional practice as well as to share more off-topic blogs about my life, hobbies, opinions and concerns.
